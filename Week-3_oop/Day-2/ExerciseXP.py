# üåü Exercise 3 : Dogs Domesticated
# Instructions
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True

# play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: ‚Äúdog_names all play together‚Äù.

# do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
# ‚Äúdog_name does a barrel roll‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name stands on his back legs‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name shakes your hand‚Äù.
# ‚Äúdog_name plays dead‚Äù.
